This project on the visualization of Bach's Fugue BWV 846 was a process of trial and error with the D3 javascript library. As I had just started to learn the basics of the tool, the final results were minimal, however the preceded sketching and research on the musical form was quite helpful in developing a visual language for the task.

Here some excerpts of the sketchbook, as I started working on the topic:

Three visualization where developed for the project:
<ul>
  <li>Melodic lines and subject appearance</li>
  <li>Subject allocation across musical measures</li>
  <li>Subject allocation across voices</li>
</ul>
