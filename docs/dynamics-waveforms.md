		Dynamics, the amount of energy experienced as "loudness" or "quietness", is a key feature in sound perception. Unavoidably, it is associated with the concept of being "small" or "large": the louder a section is, the "bigger" we conceive it to be. Passages from soft to loud or vice verca evoke impressions of movement going upwards or downwards.<sup>1</sup> In this regard, waveforms or waveform-like shapes become convenient tools for visual representations: with their vertical axis depicting changes in air pressure (displacement of air molecules due to sound phenomena), they can be used as visual surrogates for loudness. Their vertical axis represents amplitude and the peaks in changes of air pressure are useful mediums in distinguishing between different levels of dynamics.<sup>2</sup>
		<br/><br/>
		Horizontally, the varying patterns of waveforms relate mainly to timbral characteristics and harmonics. However, it is not easy to discern these values intuitively: "while waveforms provide exactness in the realms of amplitude and duration through visual peaks and valleys, the vital categories of pitch and harmonic content become inaccessible.”<sup>3</sup>
		<br/><br/>
		Even if pitch and harmonics are not the focus of discussion here, it is important to recognize waveforms as spatial and topographical assets when deciphering sound.

1 Characteristic is the depiction of crescendo (soft—>loud) and diminuendo (loud—>soft) wih the symbols "<" and ">" respectively.<br/>
2 Loudness and amplitude are used interchangeably, although it should be clarified that loudness is a psychoacoustical phenomenon, based on human perception, whereas amplitude is the displacement of a wave from its mean value (displacement of air molecules).<br/>
