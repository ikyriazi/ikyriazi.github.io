This is a visualization of orchestra instruments. Each instrument is colored differently, and instruments of the same family have colors of similar hue. As exemplified by the animations, the goal has been to visualize instruments according to the following characteristics:
- <b>color</b> to represent instrument and instrumental family
- <b>length of arc</b> to represent instrument's prominence / duration in relation to the whole piece
- <b>speed of animation</b> to represent tempo / rhythmical patterns of each instrument
