		The sequence of notes and the trace they leave in our memory constitute core elements of sound and music perception. Melody, the "pitched sounds arranged in musical time,”<sup>1</sup> is key in work identification. Moreover, there is another definition of melody, that of a prominent sequence of sounds that can be easily distinguished from other synchronous sequences (often of a supporting nature and known as accompaniment).
		<br/><br/>
		The exact, note-to-note representation of melodies is not prerequisite for extracting musical patterns and contours. As a side note, before the invention of modern music notation (that is, before Guido von Arezzo's Micrologus de disciplina artis musicae in 1025),<sup>2</sup> notation itself was used as an approximate indication of melody, consisting of neumes that didn't provide an exact representation of pitch but rather an indication of movement in up- or downwards directions.
		<br/><br/>
		Moreover, apart from the horizontal sequence of sounds, there is also a vertical dimension across the different voices or instruments of a work, which defines its texture and has an impact on its perception. The ways the voices / instruments<sup>3</sup> connect to each other can be various and the following list summarizes the most predominant of them:<sup>4</sup>
		<br/><br/>
		<ul>
		<li><i>monophonic type/alignment</i>: a single melodic line with no accompaniment</li>
		<li><i>biphonic type/alignment</i>: two lines, one being the melody, the other one being a constant pitch or pattern as accompaniment</li>
		<li><i>polyphonic type/alignment</i>: multiple melodic lines, independent from one another</li>
		<li><i>homophonic type/alignment</i>: polyphonic type with the melody line being harmonically accompanied by the rest of voices</li>
		<li><i>counterpoint / contrapuntal type/alignment</i>: polyphonic type with the lines interwoven with one another</li>
		</ul>
		As a guidance for future visualizations, I have created a simple diagram (to be seen in fig. 1). In addition to a visual scheme, I assigned a factor of complexity (coefficient) to each textural type.
