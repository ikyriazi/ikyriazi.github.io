For this visualization, music contours were extracted from MIDI sequences. A Processing sketch analyzed tracks and MIDI events, and used the pitch heights, note durations and musical rests to provide a visual counterpart to each instrument. The following image is a collection of the generated contours, whereas further elaboration of the code may potentially reveal additional insights regarding alignment and voice relationships within different compositional styles.
