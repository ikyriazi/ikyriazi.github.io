For this visualization music contours were extracted from MIDI sequences. A processing sketch analyzed tracks and midi events, and extracted pitch heights, note durations and musical rests, thus providing a visual counterpart to melodic movements for each instrument. The following image is a collection of the generated contours, and further elaboration on the code can potentially reveal more insights regarding the alignment and voice relationships between different compositional styles.
