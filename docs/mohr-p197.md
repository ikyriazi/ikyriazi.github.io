    Manfred Mohrs <i>P-197 Cubic Limit II (1979)</i> is the counterpart of <i>P-197 / K Cubic Limit II (1977)</i> (for the latter, see image). Their difference is that the 1979 work (black) is the negative of the 1977 work (white). Both are based on the same principle, that of cube manipulation, which Mohr dealt with in the <i>Cubic Limit I</i> and <i>II</i> series.

    More precisely, in both works a cube is divided by its center into two half cubes, which are rotated independently of each other. An important component of the composition is the three-dimensional representation of the original cube in frontal view, as defined by a two-dimensional "square window", which is though invisible. Graphically, the edges of the half cubes are accentuated, as long as they are located within the square (see image).

    The 1979 piece (to be reconstructed; see image) consists of 64 such cubes (64 * 2 half cubes), which are represented in a 8x8 matrix.

<b>Reconstruction</b> (made with Processing; a new iteration of cubes is generated when running the sketch anew):
