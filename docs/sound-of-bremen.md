The project is based on the question “Who owns the air?”. If you take a closer look at the air element, you will know that it consists of many small molecules that are displaced, as sound waves generate sound. Sound behaves differently depending on its environment. In addition to direct sound transmission, it can be absorbed, reflected or dampened. The sound fills the air and the air fills the city.

The totality of city sounds create the city acoustics, a term used for the variety of acoustic events typically found in urban environments: road and air traffic, acoustic signals, people, music, nature and construction noise. Such events can be assigned to different components, which help analyze individual soundscapes. The term soundscape was coined by the Canadian composer and sound researcher R. Murray Schafer, who in 1971 brought the “World Soundscape Project” into being. Schafer classifies the soundscape into three main characteristics: <i>keynote</i>, <i>signal</i> and <i>soundmark</i>. The <i>keynote</i> describes the basic tone, the basis of the soundscape, for example road traffic. <i>Signals</i>, or <i>signal sounds</i>, are clearly contoured sounds: usually they are warning signs, like bells, whistles, horns, sirens, etc. The third component is made up of <i>soundmarks</i> (orientation sounds). They are site-specific and give a soundscape its acoustic recognition value. The connection between sound and landmark, the <i>soundmark</i>, makes the connection between sound and a specific location very clear.

The <a href="https://stadtklang-bremen.wixsite.com/soundofbremen/klangarchiv" target="_blank">sound archive</a> provided in the exhibition INTERSPACE shows that Bremen offers a variety of sounds that are not immediately perceived the first time you listen. According to a survey with the local citizens, it became clear that the sound is perceived as one-sided. The investigation of three characteristic locations shows that not only the tram dominates acoustically, but also repeated construction noises, as well. This is currently affecting the soundscape at Domheide / Marktplatz. In order to acoustically enhance these places, it is necessary to remove disturbing sounds from the soundscape. On the other hand, positive and identity-forming sounds are embedded in the areas of Schlachte and Europahafen. The soundscapes are permanently changed through different <a href="https://stadtklang-bremen.wixsite.com/soundofbremen/klangintervention" target="_blank">interventions</a> using new materials and platforms.
